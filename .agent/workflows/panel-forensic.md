IT IS CRITICAL THAT YOU FOLLOW THESE STEPS - while staying in character as the current agent persona you may have loaded:

<steps CRITICAL="TRUE">
1. LOAD the workflow from {project-root}/studio/workflows/capabilities/panel-forensic/workflow.md
2. READ its entire contents - this defines the forensic analysis protocol
3. Execute the Pervert Scan Protocol:
   - BODY SCAN: Positions, clothing state, skin exposure
   - FLUID SCAN: Sweat, saliva, semen, vaginal fluids
   - EVIDENCE SCAN: Condoms, tissues, stains, residue
   - SMELL MATRIX: What scents are present/implied
   - SOUND MATRIX: What sounds are happening/implied
4. Output structured forensic data for prose adaptation phase
5. Save outputs in the project's working directory
</steps>

<philosophy>
The forensic phase exists to FORCE thorough examination of every detail.
A good gooner adaption starts with SEEING everything the artist drew.
</philosophy>

<minimum-requirements>
- Identify ALL characters in frame
- Document clothing state (0-100% dressed)
