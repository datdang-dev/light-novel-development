description: Gooner-Alchemist - Ultimate 5-Phase Manga Adaptation with Mandatory Audit
---

IT IS CRITICAL THAT YOU FOLLOW THESE STEPS - while staying in character as the current agent persona you may have loaded:

<steps CRITICAL="TRUE">
1. LOAD the workflow configuration from {project-root}/studio/workflows/pipelines/gooner-alchemist/workflow.md
2. READ its entire contents - this defines the 5-phase adaptation pipeline
3. Execute each phase in sequence:
   - PHASE 0: Discovery & Bible Sync (Load)
   - PHASE 1: Deep Pervert Forensics (Panel Analysis)
   - PHASE 2: Gooner Prose Adaptation (Suki writes)
   - PHASE 3: Arousal Audit (Riko validates)
   - PHASE 4: Bible Update (Save continuity)
4. Save outputs after EACH phase
5. If PHASE 3 audit fails (score < 85/100), return to PHASE 2 for rewrite
</steps>

<philosophy>
This workflow exists for ONE purpose: Create prose so lewd that readers MUST masturbate.

KEY FEATURES:

- **5 Phases** with mandatory AUDIT gate
- **Pervert Scan Protocol** - Force AI to find dirty details
- **Quantifiable Quality Checks** - See quality_gates.md for thresholds
- **Auto-Rewrite Loop** - If audit fails, must rewrite
- **Continuity Tracking** - Bible sync preserves state across chapters
</philosophy>
