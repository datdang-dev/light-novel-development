# Scene Boundaries

## NEW SCENE Triggers

A new scene starts when ANY of these occur:

- **Location change** — moving from classroom to rooftop
- **Time skip** — "30 minutes later", next day, etc.
- **POV shift** — camera switches to a different character's perspective
- **Major tonal shift** — comedy to explicit, setup to climax

## SAME SCENE Continuations

These do NOT warrant a new scene:

- Panel transitions within the same location and timeframe
- Camera angle changes (close-up → wide shot)
- New character entering an existing scene
- Flashback panels (mark with `> *Hồi tưởng—*` instead)

## Scene Naming

Each scene gets a Vietnamese title reflecting its emotional core, not its page number.

| ❌ Wrong | ✅ Right |
|----------|---------|
| "Scene from Page 003" | "Mùi Hương Cấm Kỵ" |
| "Continuation" | "Lưỡi Và Bao Quy Đầu" |
