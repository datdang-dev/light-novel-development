# LND Studio Comprehensive Audit Report

**Date:** 2026-02-10
**Auditor:** BMad Master (Antigravity Agent)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETES - UPGRADES APPLIED

## 1. Executive Summary

The LND Studio has been audited to address the following critical user complaints:

1. **"Atomic Scan" Failures:** Missing key evidence (condoms, debris).
2. **"Dry" Prose:** Lack of stimulation/arousal.
3. **Workflow Bugs/Skips:** General instability.

All identified issues have been traced to **insufficiently strict agent instructions** rather than code errors. The "Human-in-the-Loop" protocols (Agents) were being too lenient.

## 2. Department-Level Upgrades

### 🔬 Forensic Department (Prof. Atomic)

* **Issue:** "Zero-Skip" was an abstract concept, allowing the agent to skip items it deemed "unimportant".
* **Fix:** Implemented **NEGATIVE CONFIRMATION PROTOCOL**.
* **New Rule:** `panel-forensic/steps/step-03-panel-breakdown.md` now requires a mandatory **Hentai Lexicon Checklist**.
  * *Must explicitly state "Condom: None" instead of omitting it.*
  * *Must explicitly scan for "Stray Pubic Hair" and "Fluids" in every panel.*

### ✍️ Prose Department (Suki)

* **Issue:** Prose was chemically accurate but emotionally dry. Failed to induce "Gooner Brain".
* **Fix:** Implemented **LEXICON INJECTION & INFERENCE PROTOCOL**.
* **New Rule:** `prose-adapter/steps/step-04-action-prose.md` mandates usage of specific sensory words from `hentai_lexicon.md`.
  * *Added "Inference Protocol":* If forensic data is incomplete, Suki is now authorized to **INFER** wet/messy details based on "Gooner Logic" (e.g., sex implies fluids).

### 💬 Dialogue Department (Miki)

* **Issue:** Dialogue felt "scripted" and ignored physical constraints (e.g., clear speech while choking).
* **Fix:** Implemented **AUDIO-VISUAL SYNC**.
* **New Rule:** `dialogue-generator/steps/step-04-dialogue-generation.md` enforces a check: "Does voice match physical action?"
* **New Rule:** **NO FILLER**. Banned casual chatter during sex scenes.

### 🧐 Quality Assurance (Riko)

* **Issue:** Feedback was "Fail" without guidance, causing revision loops.
* **Fix:** Implemented **CONSTRUCTIVE CRUELTY**.
* **New Rule:** `gooner-editor.md` now MUST provide a specific "better example" when failing a piece.

## 3. Workflow Stability

* **Review:** `gooner-alchemist` pipeline logic is sound.
* **Optimization:** The upgrades above act as "Quality Filters" at each step, preventing garbage data from propagating downstream.
* **Protocol:** Ensure `hentai_lexicon.md` is always loaded (added to step files).

## 4. Next Steps

The system is ready for a **Test Run**.

**Recommended Actions:**

1. **Clear Cache:** Delete old `_analysis` files for the target page to force a fresh "Atomic Scan".
2. **Run Pipeline:** Execute `/gooner-alchemist` or `[MP] Master Production`.
3. **Verify:** Check the new `audit_report.md` output from Riko to see if scores improve.
