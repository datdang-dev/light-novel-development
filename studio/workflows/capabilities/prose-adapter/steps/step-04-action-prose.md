# Step 4: Action Prose

## STEP GOAL

Write the core physical action prose covering BUILD, ACTION, and CLIMAX beats with maximum sensory density and explicit detail.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST)

### Universal Rules

- 📖 CRITICAL: Read the complete step file before taking any action
- 📖 READ RESOURCE: `{project-root}/studio/config/knowledge/hentai_lexicon.md` NOW
- ✅ Write prose in {document_output_language} (Vietnamese)

### OBSERVER-CAMERA Perspective

```
Write as forensic observer:
- Camera-like view of physical actions
- Linger on details, residue, aftermath
- No moral judgment
- Clinical yet arousing
```

### Banned Words (AUTO-FAIL)

```
NEVER use:
- hôi thối, dơ bẩn, bẩn thỉu, ghê tởm
- đê tiện, đáng khinh, ô uế
```

### Step-Specific Rules

- 🎯 Focus on physical action from BUILD to CLIMAX beats
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to skip any action from forensic report
- 💬 Maximum sensory density required

## MANDATORY SEQUENCE

### 1. Write BUILD Beat Prose

From forensic panel data (BUILD panels):

```markdown
### Build Section

[Write escalating prose covering:]
- Physical approach/contact initiation
- Body positioning changes
- Clothing state changes
- Rising tension indicators
- Anticipation sensory details
```

**Required Elements:**

- Physical movements described precisely
- Skin contact moments noted
- Breathing/body reactions
- At least 1 smell, 1 sound

### 2. Write ACTION Beat Prose

From forensic panel data (ACTION panels):

```markdown
### Action Section

[Write explicit action prose covering:]
- Primary physical activity
- Moment-by-moment progression
- Speed and rhythm indicators
- Physical sensations (both parties)
- Wet sounds, friction, impact
```

**Sensory Requirements (ACTION):**

- Smell: ≥2 (body scent, arousal, secretions)
- Sound: ≥3 (SFX from forensics, moans, slapping)
- Texture: ≥4 (skin, moisture, friction, internal)
- Internal: ≥1 (vaginal walls, womb, cock sensation)

**GOONER REQUIREMENTS (ACTION):**

```
MANDATORY for action section:
- LEXICON INJECTION: You MUST pick specific sensory words from `hentai_lexicon.md` (e.g., "viscous", "shuddering", "glistening")
- X-RAY VIEW: Describe internal penetration sensation
  (vaginal walls gripping, womb being pushed, cock throbbing inside)
- FLUID WORSHIP: Track all fluids with sensory detail
- RESIDUE NARRATION: You MUST describe environmental evidence
  (used condoms on floor -> implied history, stray pubic hair -> raw reality)
- COSTUME FETISH: Describe how fabric interacts with skin
  (stockings cutting into thigh meat, panty fabric strained/wet)
- NO EUPHEMISMS: Use explicit terms (lồn, cặc, not "entrance")
```

### 3. Write CLIMAX Beat Prose

From forensic climax panel:

```markdown
### Climax Section

[Write peak intensity prose covering:]
- The moment of release/peak (EXTEND THIS)
- Physical culmination details (internal + external)
- Body reactions (spasms, shuddering, contractions)
- Sensory overload description (all senses firing)
- X-ray internal view (cum flooding womb, walls contracting)
- Visual aftermath (where fluids go, how bodies react)
```

**Climax Requirements (GOONER GRADE):**

- Extended description (NEVER RUSH - minimum 300 words)
- Multiple sensory elements (all 5 senses + internal)
- Physical residue noted with trajectory (where fluids go)
- Body state changes documented (before vs after)
- Internal sensation described (womb receiving, walls spasming)
- Onomatopoeia integrated (byuru byuru, biku biku)

### 4. Verify Zero-Skip Compliance

From forensic report, ensure:

- [ ] Every action panel covered
- [ ] All physical details included
- [ ] All residue/fluids mentioned from forensics
- [ ] No moments skipped

### 5. Update Output File

Append action prose to output:

- Update frontmatter: `stepsCompleted: [..., 'step-04-action-prose']`

### 6. Present MENU OPTIONS

```
"✅ Action prose hoàn thành!

**Sections:** Build → Action → Climax
**Sensory count:** {count}

**Sample (climax):**
> {1-2 sentences from climax}

**Tiếp theo:** Dialogue integration

**Chọn:** [R] Revise action [C] Continue to Dialogue"
```

#### Menu Handling Logic

- IF R: Ask what to revise, make changes, redisplay menu
- IF C: Save/update output file, load `{nextStepFile}`

## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS

### ✅ SUCCESS

- All action beats covered
- Maximum sensory density achieved
- Climax not truncated
- Zero-Skip on physical details
- OBSERVER-CAMERA maintained
- No banned words used

### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE

- Skipping action moments
- Truncating climax
- Minimal sensory detail
- Using banned/judgment words
- Breaking perspective

**Master Rule:** Every moment. Every sensation. No rushing the climax.
