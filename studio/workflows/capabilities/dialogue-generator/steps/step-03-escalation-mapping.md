# Step 3: Escalation Mapping

## STEP GOAL:

Map dialogue intensity to match scene escalation phases.

## ESCALATION PHASES

```
1. SETUP (10%)
   - Normal conversation
   - Hints of tension
   - Dialogue: coherent, complete sentences

2. BUILD (30%)
   - Flirtation / power play
   - Rising tension
   - Dialogue: shorter, more charged

3. ACTION (40%)
   - Active engagement
   - Intense exchange
   - Dialogue: fragmented, crude, interrupted by SFX

4. CLIMAX (15%)
   - Peak intensity
   - Minimal coherent speech
   - Dialogue: broken words, moans, SFX dominant

5. AFTERMATH (5%)
   - Come-down
   - Processing
   - Dialogue: breathless, satisfied/shocked
```

## MANDATORY SEQUENCE

### 1. Map Scene Beats

```markdown
## Escalation Mapping

| Phase | Panel/Section | Intensity | Dialogue Style |
|-------|---------------|-----------|----------------|
| Setup | 1-2 | 10% | {coherent} |
| Build | 3-4 | 30-60% | {charging} |
| Action | 5-7 | 70-90% | {fragmented} |
| Climax | 8 | 100% | {broken} |
| After | 9 | 20% | {breathless} |
```

### 2. Define Intensity Markers

```
At 30%: Start using crude words
At 50%: Sentences fragment
At 70%: SFX interrupts dialogue
At 90%: Mostly moans + single words
At 100%: Pure reaction sounds
```

### 3. Present MENU

```
"✅ Escalation mapped!

**Phases:** {count}
**Peak at:** {section}

**Tiếp theo:** Generate dialogue

**Chọn:** [C] Continue"
```
