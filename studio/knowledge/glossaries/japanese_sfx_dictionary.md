### Introduction

This is compiled collection of common Japanese SFXes (sound effects or onomatopoeia).

This collection mostly uses Romaji transliterations. The original version was compiled for general public use but modified later for project-use. Some SFXs may be used in combination with other SFXs; some SFXs, or combinations thereof, may be written separately for emphasis within the same panel (example: do- ki-, ドッキッ ), but can be considered as part of the same action; some use repeated sub-elements or prolongation characters (ー) within them. All of the interjections can be written differently, usually to show particularly strong stimulation. For example, a *cho* in isolation is almost certainly a cut off version of *chotto* where the speaker was distracted from finishing the word. Prolongation of a character, on the other hand, often implies lazy, harsh or sloppy pronunciation, or even possibly a scream. Because of this, many SFXs can have multiple meanings and are dependent on the action drawn, as well as one's interpretation of that action.

### ADDITIONAL NOTES

Vowels accompanied by two diagonal scratches (diacritic mark, dakuten/ten-ten: ゛) are a relatively new way to indicate a particularly loud, groaning or husky sound, a feature English can't replicate fully, except maybe with occasional capital letters.  

Any sound extended with 〜 is wavering. 

A syllable extended with more of the same vowel, only smaller (like in はぁ) trails off.  

A small hiragana っ, or katakana ッ (tsu) after anything can indicate an abrupt finish, and can also be inserted right into words where it isn't normally found, usually showing difficulty speaking while gasping. Can be substituted with "h" containing sounds.  

In some works you may see the word まって (matte, lit. "wait"), which is translated nowadays since it's usually used quite simply and literally. 

Finally, a concluding よ (yo) adds emphasis with attempted authority.  

Kurikaeshi (くりかえし):  
 ヽ repetition mark in katakana;  
 ヾ voiced repetition mark in katakana;  
 ゝ repetition mark in hiragana;  
 ゞ voiced repetition mark in hiragana; repetition of kanji (sometimes voiced);  
 々 repetition of kanji (sometimes voiced);
