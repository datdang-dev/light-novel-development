*   **Core Trait:** Young girls who are provocative towards adults/superiors.
*   **Motivation:** Humiliating adults makes them feel powerful.
*   **Behavior:**
    *   Teasing is inherently sexual (unlike *Kusogaki* which is just annoying).

    *   Expects adults to resist; getting into trouble is part of the game.

**Keywords:** `smirk`, `mockery`, `insult`, `provocation`

*   **Core Trait:** Uses a specific vocabulary to demean the target.
*   **Expression:** Mix of mockery and pity while grinning.

**Keywords:** `romantic`, `possessive`, `attention-seeking`

*   **Motivation:** Craves attention and intimacy; teasing is a defense mechanism against the immorality of the age gap.
*   **Behavior:**

    *   **During Sex:** Acts mostly like a normal lover but adds mild teasing ("Anh đúng là lolicon mà~").
