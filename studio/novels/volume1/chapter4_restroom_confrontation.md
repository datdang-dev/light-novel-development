# Chapter 4: The Restroom Confrontation (Part 1)

The door to the faculty restroom clicked shut, cutting off the ambient noise of the Sazaki Academy hallway. The sudden silence was heavy, broken only by the hum of the ventilation and the sharp intake of breath from the girl standing behind me.

Asuka Anders. Disciplinary Committee Chair. The "Princess" of the school.

And currently, a nervous wreck.

I leaned against the sink, crossing my arms as I watched her fidget. Her golden ponytail swayed as she paced back and forth, her fingers twisting a lock of hair—a telltale sign of her anxiety.

"So..." she started, her voice tight. "Why does my mother need to see you, anyway? Did you do something stupid again? I *told* you not to cause any trouble."

I raised an eyebrow. "Is that your 'Chairwoman' voice, Asuka? Or are you actually worried about me?"

"I-I'm not worried about *you*!" she scoffed, though her eyes darted away from mine. "I'm worried about the committee's reputation! If the Vice-Chair gets in trouble, it reflects badly on me."

"Likely story," I muttered, pushing off the sink and taking a step towards her. "You know, for someone who claims to hate trouble, you sure love following it around. You've been tailing me since I left the classroom."

"I was not tailing you! I was just... ensuring you arrived at the office without causing a scene!"

"In the boys' restroom?"

She flushed, her composure cracking. "T-This is a unisex faculty restroom! It's neutral ground!"

"Fair enough." I smirked. "But let's cut the act. You're terrified Helen is going to expel me, aren't you?"

Asuka bit her lip. "She... she's been on edge lately. Explosive. You saw how she treated Yoko-sensei earlier."

Ah, yes. Yoko. The perpetually drunk, cleavage-baring teacher who had made the mistake of calling me a "Perverted Pizza Man" in front of the class.

"Yoko dug her own grave," I said dismissively. "She has zero self-awareness."

"But she called you a pervert!" Asuka clenched her fists. "How can you let her talk to you like that? You're the head of the DC! She needs to be punish—"

"Asuka." My voice was sharp, cutting through her rant. "We've talked about this. The best punishment for an attention-seeker like Yoko is to ignore her. Engaging just gives her what she wants."

"But—"

"Enough." I stepped closer, invading her personal space. She froze, her back hitting the tiled wall. "Why are you really here? It's not about Yoko. It's about us."

Her defiance evaporated. She looked up at me, her blue eyes wide and glistening with unshed tears. The "Gap" between her haughty public persona and this trembling girl was always staggering.

"Am I..." she whispered, her voice trembling. "Am I the only one you treat this way? The only one you give the stick to, instead of the carrot?"

"What can I say?" I reached out, tucking a stray hair behind her ear. She leaned into the touch instinctively. "You're special."

"Special..." She repeated the word, grasping at it like a lifeline. "Then... prove it."

A sudden shift. Her gaze hardened, a flicker of desperate determination igniting in her eyes.

"Prove it?" I withdrew my hand. "And how do you propose I do that?"

"Promise me something," she said, her voice gaining a shaky strength. "Promise me that... that you won't look at other girls. At least when I'm around! Takeshita-san, Murasaki-san... you're always looking at them!"

My eyes narrowed. "Are we really doing this again? You're trying to negotiate terms?"

"It's not a negotiation! It's a request! I... I want you to look only at me!"

She pressed her hands to her chest, her breathing shallow. "I know we aren't 'official' or anything, but... if I'm special, then show me! Make me feel it!"

I stared at her for a long moment. Calculating.

She was trying to use her feelings, her body, her very presence as leverage. A clumsy, amateurish attempt at a power play.

"Asuka," I said coldly. "Do you remember what I told you about leverage?"

"W-What?"

"It only works if what you have is worth more than what you're asking for." I turned my back on her. "If you're going to try and paywall your affection, then I guess I'm not interested. Catch you later."

I started walking towards the door.

"Wait!"

The panic in her voice was immediate. I heard her scramble after me, her hand grabbing my sleeve.

"No! Don't go! I... I withdraw the request! Forget I said anything!"

I stopped but didn't turn around. "You withdraw it?"

"Yes! Please... just don't leave me. I didn't mean it like that!"

I turned slowly. Asuka was trembling, tears now freely streaming down her cheeks. The haughty Chairwoman was gone, replaced by a terrified child afraid of being abandoned.

"I... I just don't know what to do," she sobbed. "I felt like you were drifting away... like I was losing you. And I didn't have anyone to talk to..."

"So?"

"So I went online!" she blurted out. "On ChikTalk! And I watched these videos on 'How to Keep Your Man' and 'Alpha Female Dating Strategies'..."

I blinked. "ChikTalk? You're taking relationship advice from fifteen-second clips made by influencers who probably sell bathwater?"

"T-The videos had millions of likes!" she defended weakly. "They said I needed to play hard to get! That I needed to make you come to me!"

"Asuka..." I sighed, pinching the bridge of my nose. "You are an honors student. You run the disciplinary committee. And yet, you are taking strategic advice from 'Cunty Cosmo'?"

"Don't be mean!" she wailed, burying her face in her hands. "I didn't know what else to do! I've never... I've never liked anyone before! I don't know how this works!"

The pathetic cuteness of it almost made me laugh. *Almost.*

But beneath the absurdity, there was a raw, bleeding wound. She was terrified. Not of losing a boyfriend, but of being discarded.

"Asuka," I said, my voice softening just a fraction. "Look at me."

She peeked through her fingers, her eyes red and puffy.

"You don't need 'strategies'," I said. "And you certainly doesn't need to play games with me. You know exactly what I want."

"I... I do?"

"Submission," I said simply. "Honesty. And obedience."

I reached out and lifted her chin.

"If you want to keep me, Asuka... just be a good girl. Can you do that?"

She nodded frantically, sniffling. "Y-Yes. I can be a good girl. I promise."

"Good." I brushed my thumb across her wet cheek. "Now, dry your tears. We have a meeting to get to. And you look like a mess."
