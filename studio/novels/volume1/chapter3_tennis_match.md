# Chapter 3: The Queen's Fall (Day 21)

The mid-afternoon sun beat down on the Sazaki Academy tennis courts, turning the clay surface into a frying pan. It was hot, oppressive, and utterly perfect for the humiliation that was about to unfold.

On one side of the net stood the "Queens" of the Academy: Principal Helen Anders, a woman whose beauty defied her age, and her daughter, Asuka Anders, the Disciplinary Committee Chair. Asuka stood with her chin raised high, her golden hair tied back in a ponytail that bobbed with every arrogant huff of breath. She looked every bit the inviolable idol she claimed to be.

On the other side stood Sheila and myself. The "Commoners." The "Trash."

"Serving!" Helen announced, her voice as crisp as a freshly ironed banknote.

The ball hissed through the air. It was a good serve—fast, precise. Sheila yelped, barely managing to connect with her racket. The ball looped high and slow, a pathetic duck waiting to be shot down.

"Create space!" I shouted, feigning panic as I scrambled to the side.

"I've got it!" Asuka cried out, glee evident in her voice. She smashed the easy return.

I watched the yellow blur approach. I could have returned it. I could have placed it in the far corner where she’d never reach it. My muscles twitched with the urge to do just that—to wipe that smug grin off her face right then and there.

But not yet.

"Oh darn!" I exclaimed, intentionally swinging a fraction of a second too late. "I couldn't make it in time..."

The ball bounced past me.

"Ha! Mom, did you see that?" Asuka preened, turning to her mother like a puppy seeking a treat. "Too easy!"

"Excellent work, Asuka," Helen nodded, though her sharp eyes lingered on me for a moment. "And [Player]-kun... interesting form."

She knew. Or at least, she suspected. Helen Anders was many things, but she wasn't stupid. She saw the "business decision" I was making: losing the battle to win the war. I needed her trust more than I needed a point in a friendly match.

"I apologize, Principal," I said, bowing slightly. "Asuka-san is simply on another level."

"You can say that again!" Asuka laughed, twirling her racket. "Maybe you should stick to carrying equipment, 'Vice-Chair'."

Sheila grabbed my arm, her nails digging into my skin. "Bro," she hissed, her voice trembling with suppressed rage. "I know when you're bullshitting. Why are we letting this... this *bitch* walk all over us?"

"Patience," I whispered back, keeping my eyes on the Prize. "I need Helen to see me as harmless. Useful. Subservient."

"I'm not doing this for free," Sheila growled.

"I know. I promise it will be worth it."

We played out the charade for another ten minutes. I flailed, I tripped, I hit wide. Asuka’s ego swelled with every point, inflating like a balloon ready to burst. She taunted us relentlessly, calling us "failures," "plebs," and "genetic dead-ends."

Then, the universe threw me a bone.

Helen's phone rang. She checked the screen, frowned, and raised a hand. "I apologize, everyone. There's an emergency with the fire suppression system in the East Wing. I clearly need to have words with the maintenance staff."

"Oh, no!" I said, masking my delight. "Please, attend to your duties, Principal. We can finish up here."

"Very well. Play nice." Helen gave me one last, calculating look before striding off the court.

The moment the gate clicked shut behind her, the atmosphere shifted. The heavy, suffocating pressure of the Principal's presence vanished, leaving only the raw, unchecked hostility of her daughter.

Asuka turned to us, her smile twisting into a sneer. "Well, with the only competent player gone, I suppose this match is effectively over. The court smells so much cleaner when the trash takes itself out, don't you think?"

Sheila threw her racket down. "That's it! Asuka, you're a toxic, stuck-up, daddy-issue-ridden nightmare! I'm out!"

"Sheila, wait-" I started, but she was already storming off towards the locker rooms. "Feel free to trash her now," I called after her. "Madam Anders is gone."

"I'd rather shave my head!" Sheila yelled back without turning around.

And then there were two.

Silence descended on the court. A slight breeze ruffled Asuka’s skirt, teasing the white spats underneath.

"Well," Asuka scoffed, placing a hand on her hip. "Looks like your partner abandoned you, too. Typical. Weakness attracts weakness."

I slowly picked up a ball, tossing it lightly in the air. The "clumsy transfer student" posture evaporated from my shoulders. I stood straight, rolling my neck until it cracked.

"You know, Asuka," I said, my voice dropping an octave, losing all traces of deference. "I was wondering when you'd shut up."

Asuka blinked, taken aback by the sudden shift. "E-Excuse me? Who do you think you're talking to?"

"I'm talking to a spoiled brat who thinks she won a game she didn't play," I said, walking slowly towards the service line. "Did you really think you were scoring points? Or did you just not notice that I was feeding you?"

Her face flushed red. "How dare you! I'm the best player in this school! You were just... you were flailing around like a headless chicken!"

"Is that so?" I smirked. "Then you won't mind finishing the set. One on one."

"Fine!" she shrieked. "But since I'm clearly going to win, let's make it interesting. The loser has to play a 'Batsu Game'. A Penalty Game."

"Oh?" I raised an eyebrow. "And what does the Princess have in mind?"

"If I win," she pointed a manicured finger at me, "you have to bark like a dog in the hallway for a week. Every time you see me."

"Accepted," I said instantly. "And when I win..." I looked her up and down, lingering on the curve of her hips. "... I'll figure something out."

"Hah! You won't get the chance! Serving!"

She served. It was fast—angry fast.

But I wasn't playing the fool anymore.

I stepped in. *Snap.*

The racket connected with a satisfying *thwack*. The ball rocketed back, skimming the net and landing dead in the corner of her court before she had even finished her follow-through.

"15-Love," I said calmly.

Asuka froze, staring at the spot where the ball had landed. "W-What? That was... luck!"

"Luck," I repeated. "Sure. Let's try again."

I tossed the ball. "I'm going to hit this one to your backhand. Right... *there*." I pointed to the far left corner.

"You can't just tell me-"

*POK.*

The ball flew exactly where I pointed. Asuka lunged for it, but it was too fast, too precise. It bounced past her outstretched racket with mechanical indifference.

"30-Love."

"N-No!" She was panting now, sweat beading on her forehead. "The sun! It was in my eyes! Retake!"

"The sun is behind you, Asuka," I said dryly. "Unless you've developed photosensitivity to your own ego, that excuse won't fly."

"Shut up! Serve!"

*POK.*

"40-Love."

She was unraveling. The perfect Ojou-sama was gone, replaced by a flustered, desperate girl who couldn't understand why the world had suddenly stopped obeying her.

"One more point," I said, walking up to the net. "And then... the Penalty Game."

I didn't even serve hard this time. I hit a soft, spinning drop shot that died the moment it crossed the net. Asuka ran for it, diving, her skirt fluttering up to reveal her desperate scramble. She missed it by inches.

"Game, Set, Match," I announced.

Asuka lay on the clay, breathing heavy, dirt smudging her pristine white uniform. She looked up at me, her eyes wide with a mix of shock and fear.

"I... I lost...?"

"You did," I said, crouching down so our faces were level. "And now, it's time to pay the toll."

I stood up and offered her a hand. She took it hesitantly, and I pulled her up—but I didn't let go. I yanked her forward, spinning her around and forcing her over the net post.

"H-Hey! What are you doing?!"

"The Penalty Game," I whispered in her ear. "You've been a very bad girl, Asuka. Insulting my sister. Insulting me. Acting like you own the place."

I raised my hand.

"Wait! You can't-"

*SMACK!*

My palm connected with her ass. The sound echoed across the empty courts—a sharp, stinging report that silenced the birds in the trees.

"Ah!" Asuka yelped, her body jolting. "Y-You hit me! You actually hit me!"

"I did," I said. "And I'm going to do it again until you apologize."

*SMACK!*

"Oww! S-Stop it! I'm the Chair- Ah!"

*SMACK!*

It was lighter than I expected. Her resistance, I mean. With every hit, her struggles grew weaker. Her protests shifted from "Stop it!" to "W-Wait..." to breathless gasps.

I watched her face as I struck her again. Her cheeks were flushed, her eyes wet... but not with tears of pain.

She was biting her lip. Her breath was hitching in a way that had nothing to do with running.

*She likes this,* I realized with a jolt of dark amusement. *The high-and-mighty Princess gets off on being treated like a naughty child.*

"You like this, don't you?" I murmured, sliding my hand under her skirt to pinch the soft flesh of her thigh.

"N-No!" she stammered, but her hips bucked back against me—an instinctive, betraying motion. "I... It hurts! It's humiliating!"

"Exactly," I said. "And that's why you're wet."

I could feel the heat radiating off her. She was trembling, caught in the devastating gap between her pride and her perversion.

"Say it," I commanded, grabbing her hair and pulling her head back. "Say: 'I'm a bad girl who needs to be punished.'"

"I... I can't..."

*SMACK!*

"Say it!"

"Ah! I... I'm a bad girl!" she cried out, her voice breaking. "I need... I need to be punished!"

"Good girl."

I stopped.

The silence crashed back down on us. Asuka hung there, draped over the net post, panting, waiting. Waiting for the next hit. Waiting for my hand to move further up.

I stepped back.

"W-What?" she whispered, turning to look at me with hazy, lust-filled eyes. "Why... why did you stop?"

"I think that's enough for today," I said coolly, picking up my gym bag. "The penalty has been paid."

"B-But..." She stood up shakily, her hands hovering over her red, stinging backside. She looked confused, abandoned. "I... I was..."

She was on the edge. I had brought her right to the precipice of something darker, something addictive, and then yanked the rug out from under her.

"Go home, Asuka," I said, turning to walk away. "Clean yourself up. You're a mess."

"Wait!" she called out, her voice desperate. "You can't just leave me like this! You... you coward!"

I paused and looked back over my shoulder. "Unless you want another penalty? Next time, I won't be so gentle."

I saw a shiver run through her. Fear? No. Anticipation.

She didn't follow me. She just stood there in the setting sun, clutching her skirt, watching me leave with a look of pure, unadulterated obsession.

The Queen had fallen. And the fun was just beginning.
