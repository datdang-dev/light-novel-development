# Step 6: Aftermath & Polish

## STEP GOAL:

Write the AFTERMATH section and polish all prose for consistency, sensory density compliance, and flow.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

### Universal Rules:

- 📖 CRITICAL: Read the complete step file before taking any action
- ✅ Write prose in {document_output_language} (Vietnamese)

### CRITICAL - NEVER TRUNCATE AFTERMATH:

```
AFTERMATH IS ESSENTIAL:
- Physical residue and consequences
- Character recovery states
- Continuation setup
- Extended sensory lingering
```

### Step-Specific Rules:

- 🎯 Focus on AFTERMATH beat and final polishing
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to skip or truncate post-climax content
- 💬 Linger on residue, exhaustion, consequences

## MANDATORY SEQUENCE

### 1. Write Aftermath Section

From forensic aftermath panels:

```markdown
### Aftermath Section

[Write extended aftermath prose covering:]

**Physical State:**
- Body positions post-action
- Breathing (ragged, recovering)
- Trembling, twitching residues
- Sweat, fluid traces on bodies

**Environment:**
- Stained surfaces
- Discarded items
- Changed atmosphere
- Lingering smells

**Character States:**
- Expression changes
- Eye states (glazed, tearful, satisfied)
- Muscle relaxation
- Voice changes (hoarse, weak)
```

### 2. Write Continuation Hook

If page continues to next:

```markdown
### Continuation Setup

[Write transition prose that:]
- Hints at what comes next
- Maintains tension or establishes new setup
- Sets up for next page adaptation
```

### 3. Polish Full Prose

Review ALL prose sections for:

```markdown
### Polish Checklist

**Sensory Density Verification:**
- [ ] Smell count: {X} (minimum 3)
- [ ] Sound count: {X} (minimum 3)
- [ ] Texture count: {X} (minimum 5)
- [ ] Visual: Integrated throughout

**Prose Quality:**
- [ ] Consistent OBSERVER-CAMERA perspective
- [ ] No moral judgment language
- [ ] No banned words
- [ ] Smooth transitions between sections
- [ ] Varied sentence structure

**Zero-Skip:**
- [ ] All panels represented in prose
- [ ] All residue from forensics included
```

### 4. Final Sensory Audit

Count and verify:

```
FINAL SENSORY COUNT:
- Smell: {count}/3 minimum ✓/✗
- Sound: {count}/3 minimum ✓/✗
- Texture: {count}/5 minimum ✓/✗

STATUS: {COMPLIANT / ADD MORE SENSORY}
```

If below minimum, add sensory details before proceeding.

### 5. Update Output File

Finalize prose in output:
- Update frontmatter: `stepsCompleted: [..., 'step-06-aftermath-polish']`

### 6. Present MENU OPTIONS

```
"✅ Aftermath + Polish hoàn thành!

**Sensory Compliance:**
- Smell: {count}/3 ✓
- Sound: {count}/3 ✓
- Texture: {count}/5 ✓

**Total prose length:** ~{word_count} words

**Tiếp theo:** Quality self-check

**Chọn:** [R] Revise prose [C] Continue to Quality Check"
```

#### Menu Handling Logic:

- IF R: Ask what to revise, make changes, redisplay menu
- IF C: Save/update output file, load `{nextStepFile}`

## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS

### ✅ SUCCESS:

- Aftermath section complete and detailed
- Residue and consequences documented
- All sensory minimums met
- Prose polished and consistent
- No banned words

### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:

- Truncated aftermath
- Missing residue details
- Below sensory minimums
- Inconsistent prose quality
- Banned words present

**Master Rule:** Linger on aftermath. Meet sensory minimums. Polish thoroughly.
