Sprite: {}
p: "Just like that? One talk ended centuries of bloodshed and violence?"
----------------------------------------

----------------------------------------
Context: mo "Each clan became so engrained in their role, that their clan names became almost synonymous with their tasks: a ‘Takamura’ was an officer, a ‘Sazaki’ was a teacher, a ‘Musashima’ was a soldier, and a ‘Tendo’ was a merchant."

----------------------------------------
