# Dat (Player) - Character Profile

## 🧠 Core Psychology

Dat is a classic "Avenger" protagonist driven by a deep-seated hatred for the Sazaki family and the town that destroyed his father. His worldview is transactional and cynical; he views people as "tools," "obstacles," or "targets" to be used for his revenge or pleasure.

However, he is also an **Unreliable Narrator** and a **Hypocrite**.

1. **Justification:** He constantly justifies his immoral actions (blackmail, drugging, manipulation) as "karmic justice" or "necessary for survival," claiming moral superiority over his victims even while doing worse things to them.
2. **The "Saint" Mask:** externally, he plays the role of the polite, clumsy, well-meaning transfer student to gain trust.
3. **Lust vs. Mission:** While he claims to be focused on revenge, he is easily distracted by his high libido ("Waifu Academy"), often jeopardizing or pausing his plans to pursue sexual conquests.

## 🗣️ Voice & Dialogue Style

- **Inner Monologue (True Self):**
  - **Cynical & Calculating:** Analyzes everyone for weaknesses. ("She clearly wanted to put everything behind her...", "Step one: Take control.")
  - **Vulgar & Horn:** stark contrast to his polite speech. Uses terms like "bitch," "slut," "breeding material." ("Nice ass. I bet she's heading home...", "Abby Sharpie-grade milkers.")
  - **Sarcastic:** specific disdain for the wealthy and "privileged."

- **Spoken Dialogue (The Mask):**
  - **Polite & Deferential:** "Yes, ma'am.", "I'm so sorry!", "Pleased to meet you."
  - **Clumsy/Innocent:** Uses feigned incompetence to disarm people or get closer to them (e.g., "accidentally" falling onto girls).
  - **Manipulative:** Tells people exactly what they want to hear to get what he wants.

## 💥 Key Dynamics

- **vs. Asuka:**
  - Sees her as the ultimate symbol of the Academy's arrogance.
  - Wants to "break" her to prove her purity is a lie (mirroring his own fallen status).
  - **Irony:** He considers her "scum" for being a bully, while he secretly plots to drug and blackmail her sister.

## 📝 Example Dialogue

**Context:** Inner monologue while observing a target.
**Dat (Internal):** "(Look at her. Walking around like she owns the place. She thinks her shit doesn't stink just because her daddy is on the board. One week. Give me one week, and I'll have her begging at my feet just like the rest of them.)"

**Context:** Acting polite to a teacher.
**Dat (Spoken):** "Oh, I apologize, sensei! I'm still getting used to the layout of the school. I certainly didn't mean to intrude. Could you point me toward the library?"

**Context:** Justifying a questionable action.
**Dat (Internal):** "(I'm not the bad guy here. They destroyed my family. They took *everything* from us. If I have to break a few eggs—or a few hearts—to get justice, then that's just the price of admission. Besides... she seemed to enjoy it, didn't she?)"
