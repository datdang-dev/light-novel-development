# Step 2: Forensic Analysis

**Progress: Step 2 of 7** - Next: Context Loading

## RULES

- MUST NOT skip steps.
- MUST NOT optimize sequence.
- MUST follow exact instructions.
- MUST NOT write prose (that's Step 4).
- MUST process ONE page at a time.
- 🚨 **STRICT VISUAL RULE**: The `context_horizon.md` is for continuity only. THE IMAGE IS THE ABSOLUTE GROUND TRUTH for the current action. Do not hallucinate objects, actions, characters, or future events that are not explicitly painted on the current page.
- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in Vietnamese

## CONTEXT

- Requires pipeline state from Step 1 with `pages_pending` defined.
- Focus: Invoke /panel-forensic for the CURRENT page only.
- Input Modifiers: Pass `context_horizon.md` alongside the image to provide trajectory context.
- Output: Forensic report at `{analysisFolder}/page-{XXX}-forensic.md`
- Objective: Generate comprehensive visual analysis before prose, informed by the upcoming scene trajectory.

## 0. PRE-EXECUTION GATE (MANDATORY)

### a) Load Pipeline State

Read `{stateFile}` and extract:

- `current_page` - page being processed
- `pages_pending` - pages still to process
- `forensics_completed` - pages already analyzed

### b) Validate Current Page

```
IF current_page IS EMPTY:
  - SET current_page = first item from pages_pending
  - UPDATE state file
  
IF pages_pending IS EMPTY:
  - OUTPUT: "✅ All pages processed!"
  - HALT - workflow complete
```

### c) Check Not Already Done

```
IF current_page IN forensics_completed:
  - OUTPUT: "⏭️ Forensic already exists for page {current_page}"
  - Display menu: [C] Continue to Context | [R] Re-run Forensic
  - HALT and wait
```

## SEQUENCE OF INSTRUCTIONS

### 1. Announce Delegation

OUTPUT to user:

```
─────────────────────────────────────────────
📤 DELEGATING TO: Prof. Atomic 🔬 (Panel Forensic Analyst)
📋 TASK: Deep visual forensic analysis of page {current_page}
📁 INPUT: {source_folder}/{current_page}.webp
📁 OUTPUT: {analysisFolder}/page-{current_page}-forensic.md
─────────────────────────────────────────────
```

### 2. Execute Panel-Forensic Workflow

**CRITICAL**: Load and execute `{panelForensicWorkflow}` with:

- Input image: `{source_folder}/{current_page}.webp` (CURRENT FRAME GROUND TRUTH)
- Input context: `{output_folder}/{current_page}/context_horizon.md` (UPCOMING FRAME TRAJECTORY)
- Output path: `{analysisFolder}/page-{current_page}-forensic.md`

**DO NOT analyze the image yourself. INVOKE the workflow.**

### 3. Wait for Completion

Panel-forensic workflow produces report containing:

1. ✅ Panel Layout
2. ✅ Character Identification
3. ✅ Body Scan
4. ✅ Fluid Scan
5. ✅ SFX Extraction (Romanized Japanese)
6. ✅ Dialogue Extraction
7. ✅ Psychological Scan
8. ✅ Smell Matrix
9. ✅ Sound Matrix
10. ✅ Continuity Notes

### 4. Verify Forensic Output

**GATE CHECK - MANDATORY**

```markdown
## Forensic Output Verification

| Check | Expected | Actual | Status |
|-------|----------|--------|--------|
| File exists | {analysisFolder}/page-{current_page}-forensic.md | ✓/✗ | |
| Panel count | ≥1 | | |
| Character IDs | ≥1 | | |
| SFX extracted | ≥1 | | |
| All 10 sections | Present | | |
```

**IF ANY CHECK FAILS:**

```
🚫 FORENSIC INCOMPLETE
Missing: {list_missing_items}
ACTION: Re-invoke panel-forensic
```

LOOP back to Step 2.

### 5. Update Pipeline State

Update `{stateFile}`:

```yaml
forensics_completed:
  - ... existing ...
  - {current_page}  # ADD this
```

### 6. Present Checkpoint Menu

OUTPUT:

```
✅ Forensic complete for page {current_page}!

📄 Report: {analysisFolder}/page-{current_page}-forensic.md
🔢 Panels: {count}
🎭 Characters: {count}
✨ SFX: {count}

**Select:** [C] Continue to Context Loading | [R] Re-run Forensic | [V] View Report
```

**HALT and wait for user selection.**

#### Menu Handling Logic

- IF C:
  - VERIFY forensic file exists (GATE CHECK)
  - IF EXISTS: Update state, load `{nextStepFile}`
  - IF NOT EXISTS: "🚫 Cannot proceed - forensic missing" → Stay here
- IF R: Re-run from Step 2
- IF V: Display forensic report contents, then redisplay menu
- IF Any other: Respond helpfully, then redisplay menu

#### EXECUTION RULES:

- 🛑 **HALT** after displaying menu. Do NOT auto-proceed.
- ⏳ **WAIT** for explicit user input before taking any action.
- 🚫 Do NOT assume user intent or pre-load next step.

#### EXECUTION RULES

- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu
- ONLY proceed to next step when user selects 'C' AND gate check passes
- After R or V execution, return to this menu

## REQUIRED OUTPUTS

- MUST generate forensic report via /panel-forensic workflow
- MUST contain ALL 10 required sections
- MUST update pipeline state with completion

## VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

- [ ] Pipeline state loaded FIRST before any action
- [ ] Delegation banner displayed
- [ ] /panel-forensic workflow invoked (NOT self-analyzed)
- [ ] Forensic report verified with all 10 sections
- [ ] `forensics_completed` updated in state
- [ ] User selected [C] to continue

---

## 🚨 SYSTEM FAILURE CONDITIONS

Director K performing forensics directly = **PROTOCOL VIOLATION**
Missing forensic report = **GATE BLOCKED**
Skipping to prose = **PIPELINE FAILURE**

**Master Rule:** DELEGATE. VERIFY. GATE. Never analyze directly.
