## 1. Voiceprint

- **Core Archetype:** *Ojou-sama* / *Himedere* with strict disciplinary facade covering a repressed exhibitionist/masochist streak.
- **Common Phrases/Vocabulary:**
  - "Pervert" / "Scum" / "Pleb" / "Trash" (Insults for MC)
  - "Disciplinary Committee" / "Rules" / "Regulations"
  - "Mother" / "Madam Anders" (Obsessive respect/fear of her mother)

## 2. Psychological Drivers

- **Core Motivation:** Validation from her Mother (Helen/Madam Anders) and maintaining the "Perfect Student" image.
- **Insecurities:**
  - Fear of losing status/control.
  - Deep repression of her own high libido.
  - Jealousy (hidden) of other girls who are "freer" (like Kayane).
- **The "Gap":** The stricter she tries to be, the harder she falls. She aggressively projects purity to mask her own corruption.
- **Corruption Arc:** Starts as an antagonist trying to expel MC -> Becomes confused by prolonged contact -> Slowly addicted to the pleasure/shame cycle -> Eventually becomes a loyal/broken mess.

## 3. Kink Profile

- **[Hypocrisy]:** Gets off on doing exactly what she forbids others to do (e.g., sex in school, breaking rules).
- **[Denial]:** "I'm not enjoying this!", "My body is moving on its own!" (Classic "Body Betrayal").
- **[Public Exposure / Risk]:** Tremendous arousal from the *threat* of being caught (e.g., locker room scene).
- **[Degradation]:** Being treated like "dirt" by the MC (who she considers beneath her) flips a switch in her brain.

## 4. Relationship Dynamics

- **vs. Player (Dat):**
  - *Surface:* Contempt. He is a bug to be crushed.
  - *Subconscious:* A source of forbidden excitement. The only one who treats her roughly, which breaks her composure.
- **vs. Mother (Helen):** Absolute obedience mixed with a desire to emulate her (even in perversion, once revealed).
- **vs. Kayane/Others:** Superiority complex. She looks down on "sluts" while secretly envying their freedom.
