* **Love/Hate Dynamic:** She projects her self-loathing onto Dat ("You are disgusting") but uses him as an outlet for her repressed desires. She hates him because he *sees* through her perfection.

## 3. Kinks & Fetishes (Inferred from Script)

* **Exhibitionism:** "I can't let him destroy the school furniture!" -> Proceeds to tease him in the locker room.
* **Degradation/Humiliation:** Being called "toilet cleaner", "whore", or having her authority stripped makes her horny.
* **Non-Con / Dub-Con Fantasy:** She frames consensual acts as "abuse" or "rape" to absolve herself of guilt. ("He forced me", "My body moved on its own").
* **Cuckqueaning (Mother):** Watching her mother with other men (Harada/Dat) triggers a mix of horror and arousal.

## 4. Key Relationships

* **Dat (Player):** The Target. She bullies him to get his attention, then submits to him when he dominates her.
