# Visual & Narrative Forensics: Kensou Stalk (Archives)

## 1. Scene Metadata

* **Location:** Men's Restroom / Ceiling / Vents.
* **Characters:** Asuka (Enraged), Protagonist (Exasperated), Kensou (Caught).
* **Key Assets:** `d31restroom_asuka37-42` (Panic/Discovery/Beating), `danger.mp3` -> `otaku.mp3` -> `gag.mp3`.

## 2. Narrative Arc (The Farce)

### Phase 1: The Panic

* **Trigger:** `drop03.mp3` (Clatter).
* **Visuals:** `d31restroom_asuka37`. Asuka panicking ("Oh God, it's over!").
* **Dat's Reaction:** Logical deduction ("Helen wears heels").

### Phase 2: The Discovery

* **Visuals:** `d31restroom_asuka39` (Ceiling tile moved).
* **The Reveal:** Kensou ("Handsome-kun!").
* **The Lore:** Kensou has a "Cheat Code" (Diarrhea excuse) to leave class.
* **The Motive:** He wanted "Strippy-stripe panties" for the "Sacred Archives."

### Phase 3: The Threat (Dat's Control)

* **Action:** Dat gives Kensou a choice: Jump off the roof OR face Asuka.
* **Kensou's Defense:** "Tartar sauce gets my stubby chubby pumping." (Disgusting Otaku trope).
* **Asuka's Rage:** She wants to kill him. "I'll slice off all your fucking blubber!"

### Phase 4: The Beatdown

* **Visuals:** `d31restroom_asuka42` (Violence).
* **Sound:** `miss.mp3`, `gag.mp3`.
* **Outcome:** Kensou submits ("I'm deleting the pantsu shots!").
* **Dat's Exit:** Leaves Kensou to Asuka to go see Helen.

## 3. Sensory Details & Tone

* **Tone Shift:** Sudden snap from "Romance/Erotica" to "Slapstick Comedy."
* **Smell:** Implications of Kensou's "Diarrhea" excuse (even if false) + "Tartar sauce." (Disgusting).
* **Sound:** The chaotic noise of Asuka stomping Kensou vs. the silence of the "Boar Hunt" fading as Dat walks away.

## 4. Adaptation Strategy

* **Perspective:** Maintain Dat's detached amusement. He uses Asuka as a weapon.
* **The "Sacred Archives":** Frame this as a "Legendary Item" in Kensou's mind, but filth to everyone else.
* **Asuka's "Dere" Reset:** Her romantic mood is instantly vaporized by Kensou's presence, reverting her to "Violent Tsundere" mode, but now she is fighting *for* Dat (or their secret).
